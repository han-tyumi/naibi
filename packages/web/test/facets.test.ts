/**
 * The filter chips.
 *
 * These answer "what can we play right now", and the way they fail is by saying
 * yes when the answer is no — a game shown under "1 deck" that actually needs a
 * hanafuda pack, or under "30 minutes" when it has no ending. Nothing errors;
 * someone just reaches for a deck they do not own.
 *
 * The same mistake was made once already in the command-line picker, where
 * `standard_decks: 0` passed a `<= 1` test. Both halves are pinned here: the
 * facts extracted from each entry, and the predicate the page runs on them.
