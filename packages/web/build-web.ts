 * This is a third renderer over the same data as the Markdown and the PDF. No
 * framework and no bundler: every page is written out at build time, so what
 * ships is HTML, one small stylesheet, and about forty lines of JavaScript for
 * filtering. The entire corpus is a couple of hundred kilobytes gzipped, which
 * is what makes precaching the whole thing for offline use reasonable.
 *
 * Output goes to site/, which the deploy workflow uploads to Pages as an
 * artifact. Pages is not pointed at a folder in this repository, so the name is
 * ours to choose; it was docs/ until 2026-08-09, when that name was given back

<h1>About ${TITLE}</h1>

<h2>What this is</h2>
<p>A reference for how to play card games, for the deck you already own. Every
game here is playable with cards you can buy anywhere — a standard 52-card pack,
sometimes two, occasionally a named pack the entry tells you about up front.</p>
<p>It is built for the moment it is actually needed: someone at the table asks
how a rule works, or you are teaching a game you have not played in a year. So
it loads fast, works with no signal once you have opened it, and can be
installed to a home screen like an app. There is no account, no tracking and
nothing to sign up for.</p>

<h2>The name</h2>
<p><strong>Naibi</strong> is the first European word for playing cards, recorded
in Florence in 1377. Cards reached Europe from the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt in
the 1370s and the Italians called them <em>naibi</em>, from the Arabic
<em>nā'ib</em>, "deputy" — the rank of court card in the Mamluk pack that every
European deck descends from. Spain still calls them <em>naipes</em>.</p>

<h2>How it is made</h2>
<p>Every game is one structured file: the players, the deal, the rules, the
scoring, the variants worth knowing. The website, the printable booklet and the
plain-text version are all generated from those same files, so a rule corrected
once is corrected everywhere.</p>
<p>The text is the project's own. Rules are facts and anyone may describe them,
but the words a source chose to describe them in belong to that source — so
entries here are written rather than reworded, and each one lists what it was
checked against.</p>
<p>That is the rule the project holds itself to, not a guarantee it has finished
auditing. Checking wording against a source is slow, it has caught real
mistakes before, and it is not complete across the collection. If a passage
reads close to something you have read elsewhere,
<a href="${ISSUES_URL}">please say so</a> — that is a bug, and it gets fixed.</p>

<h2>Using it elsewhere</h2>
<p>The rules text is licensed
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>: use
it, print it, build on it, including commercially, as long as you credit ${TITLE}
and share what you build on the same terms. The code that generates all this is
MIT.</p>

<h2>Corrections and contributions</h2>
<p>${games.length} games so far, and rules vary by region and family — if
something here disagrees with how you learned it, that is worth knowing.
<a href="${ISSUES_URL}">Open an issue</a> or send a change on
<a href="${REPO_URL}">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Take it with you</h2>
<p>The whole collection is also
<a href="${PDF_URL}">a printable booklet</a> — one PDF, bookmarked, a game to a
page. Or just open this site once and it stays available offline.</p>

<h3 id="install">Install it</h3>
<p>Naibi can sit on your home screen or dock and open in its own window, with no
address bar and no signal needed. Every browser that can do this keeps it in a
menu rather than on the page.</p>
<details>
<summary>Where to find it</summary>
<p>The <strong>bold words</strong> are what to look for. Exactly where a menu
item sits moves between browser versions, phone versions and your own settings,
so treat the routes below as the usual way there rather than the only one — the
names are the part that stays put.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone and iPad.</strong> Open your browser's share menu and choose
<strong>Add to Home Screen</strong>, leaving <strong>Open as Web App</strong>
switched on. It normally is; switched off you get a bookmark that opens in a
tab, which looks identical on the home screen and is not the same thing. The
share menu is usually the share button in the toolbar, or behind a ••• or the
browser's own logo — in Vivaldi it is <strong>Share Page</strong>. If Add to
Home Screen is not in the list it is more likely buried than missing: look for
<strong>View More</strong>, or scroll the actions to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Android.</strong> Look for <strong>Install</strong> or
<strong>Add to Home screen</strong> in the browser's own menu. Chrome, Edge,
Samsung Internet, Opera and Firefox all have it; Vivaldi keeps it under
<strong>Add Page To</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Computer.</strong> Chrome and Edge show an install icon in the
address bar; in Vivaldi, <strong>Install</strong> is on the tab's right-click
menu. Safari on macOS has <strong>Add to Dock</strong> in its share menu.
Firefox on the desktop does not install web apps, though Firefox on Android
does.</p>
<p class="vendors">Straight from the vendors:

 * Every game on one page, for printing a selection of them.

 * "the four-player trick-taking games" is a real thing to want on paper. So the
 * filters arrive in the query string and the page hides the rest.
 *
 * Every entry ships in the HTML because the alternative is fetching seventy-two
 * pages from the browser. That is a megabyte, so this page is deliberately left
 * out of the service worker's precache: it costs nothing until someone asks for
 * it, at the price of being the one page that needs a connection the first time.
 * Only the first time -- the fetch handler puts what it fetches, so it is in the
 * cache from then on. This used to say "the one page that does not work
 * offline", which the runtime put had made false: measured, print.html was
 * absent from the cache before a visit, present after, and rendered all 72
 * entries with the server killed.
