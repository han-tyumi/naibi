 * The PDF's structure, which is the part that fails silently.

 * landed: the bookmark, and the line on the contents page. They are supposed to
 * agree. They once did not — every bookmark pointed at the LAST page of its
 * game rather than the first, which looks perfect until you click one, and no
 * amount of reading the code makes it obvious.
 *
 * This builds the real PDF from the real corpus, which takes about a second and
 * is the only way to find out where anything actually ended up.

/**
 * Does the booklet actually print what the tables say?
 *
 * The defect no test in this file could see: build-pdf.ts drew deal tables
 * without ever reading `note`, so 30 rows across 8 entries lost 1,350
 * characters on the way to print -- rummy-500's pack counts among them --
 * while everything here stayed green. Source-level tests cannot catch it
 * either: with the deal table taken out of the booklet altogether, all 556
 * tests still passed.
 *
 * The booklet's text is glyph-encoded and answers no string search -- a search
 * for "Players" in a booklet of 80 card games finds nothing, which is how that
 * instrument was caught and thrown away. So the artifact is questioned by
 * differential: rebuild it from a corpus whose notes say something else, and
 * the bytes have to move.
 *
 * The note is REWORDED rather than removed, and that is the whole point. A
 * corpus with the notes deleted has a narrower table -- one column fewer -- so
 * its bytes differ whether or not a single note was ever printed, and a test
 * built that way passes against a booklet that drops the notes column. This one
 * was written that way first and caught doing it.
