/**
 * The README's own facts, checked against the corpus.
 *
 * The README states how many games there are, and breaks them down by family.
 * Those numbers are written by hand and every new entry makes them a little
 * more wrong — which is exactly the kind of quiet staleness the rest of this
 * project generates its way out of. The README is not generated, so it is
 * checked instead.
 *
 * Also checks the links it advertises resolve, since a badge pointing at a
 * renamed file is a broken promise on the front page.
