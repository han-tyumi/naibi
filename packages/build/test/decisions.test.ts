/**
 * The decision records.
 *
 * These exist so the reasoning behind the project survives without being
 * reconstructed from the code, which only works if they stay consistent — a
 * record nobody can find, or an index that has fallen behind the directory, is
 * the same as no record. The rest of this project gates its generated output
 * against going stale; hand-written documentation gets the cheap version of the
 * same treatment.
