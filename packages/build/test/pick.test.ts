/**
 * The picker's filter and its deck label, pulled out of main() so they can run
 * without touching process.argv.
 *
 * main() reads process.argv directly for everything else, which is exactly why
 * the deck filter went wrong for a release without anyone noticing: there was
 * nothing here to run it against. withDecksOnHand and deckLabel are the two
 * pieces of that logic that need a game and a table size rather than the
 * command line, so both are extracted and tested on their own.
