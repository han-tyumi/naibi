 * list is not evidence the phrase was found, and "no results" cannot be
 * observed at all. Worse, the actual failure mode in this project has never

 * different words in the slots -- which no phrase search would ever surface,
 * because no phrase is shared.
 *
 * So this compares structure, not strings. Two sentences that name the same
 * things in the same order are flagged even when every joining word differs,
 * which is the shape the previous passes kept finding by hand.
