# Changelog

Notable changes to the corpus, the schema and the tools that build from them.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), with the contract
being **`packages/data`: its schema and its exports**.

- **major** — a breaking change to the schema or to what the package exports:
  a field removed, a category renamed, a type narrowed. Written `feat!:` or any
  prefix with a `!`.
- **minor** — anything additive: new entries, new optional schema fields, new
  exports. Written `feat:`.
- **patch** — corrections that break nothing: prose fixes, figure fixes,
  tooling, generated output. Written `fix:` or `perf:`.

Releases are cut automatically from those prefixes when Validate goes green on
main; housekeeping types release nothing.

While the version is `0.x`, a **minor** bump may carry a breaking schema change.
That is what `0.x` means, and it is the honest label for a schema that gained a
field the week this was written. Version `1.0.0` is for when the schema stops
moving, not for when the corpus looks big enough.

The version is written in exactly one place — `packages/data/package.json` — and
read from there by everything that needs it, including the booklet's cover. The
release procedure is in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#cutting-a-release).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-03

### Added

- print a filtered selection of games from the site

### Fixed

- order versions by first difference, not by "bigger somewhere"

## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- deploy the site from Actions, so a red commit ships nothing

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-02

### Added

- **Automatic releases.** A push to main that earns one gets one, decided from
  the conventional prefix on each commit subject: `feat` a minor, `fix` a patch,
  a `!` a major, housekeeping nothing at all. The release job runs on Validate
  succeeding, so nothing is ever built from a commit that failed its own gate.
  Anything written by hand in `Unreleased` still beats the generated list.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-02

First tagged release, and the first booklet published as a release asset rather
than served out of the default branch.

### Added

- **72 game entries** across nine families, each validated against the schema,
  each rendered to Markdown, to the website, and to the printable booklet.
- **`background`**, an optional schema field for where a game comes from,
  rendered after the rules rather than before them — a reader with a deck in
  hand wants the deal, not the eighteenth century.
- **Browsing by family** on the website, with every filter carried in the URL so
  a filtered view can be linked to and printed.
- **Print styles** for the website, so a page or a filtered index prints
  legibly. A filtered sheet says how many of the corpus it is showing.
- **Type checking for the browser assets**, which nothing had ever looked at.

### Fixed

- The booklet's cover carried the date the build ran, which put the wall clock
  inside bytes that `npm run pdf -- --check` gates: the same corpus produced a
  different file the next day, and the check would have gone red on a
  repository nobody had touched. The cover now carries the version.
- The offline search fallback built an index object missing two fields the
  scorer reads.
- A difficulty the filter could not rank passed every difficulty filter, because
  `undefined > undefined` is false whichever way round it is written.
