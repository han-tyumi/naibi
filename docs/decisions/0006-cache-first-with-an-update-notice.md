# 0006. Cache first, and tell the reader when a new version lands

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-01

## Context

This gets read at a table, mid-game, on a phone that may have no signal. Freshness
matters far less than answering instantly and working offline. But cache-first
means an open page never notices a deployment, and browsers only look for a new
service worker on navigation, so a page left open never finds out at all.

## Considered options

- **Cache first, with an update notice** — chosen.
- **Network first, cache as fallback** — rejected: costs a round trip on every
  navigation, which is exactly what a reference consulted mid-game cannot afford.
- **Stale-while-revalidate** — rejected: it doubles data usage for readers who
  are often on mobile, to fix a staleness problem the update notice fixes for
  the cost of one conditional request.
- **Automatic reload on update** — rejected. Yanking the page out from under
  someone reading a scoring rule is worse than being one version behind.

## Decision

Precache the entire corpus and serve cache-first. Ask for a worker update when
the tab becomes visible. When a new version takes over, show a notice with a
Reload button — and do not reload automatically.

## Consequences

The reference is fully available with no signal, and a reader is told when it is
out of date rather than left guessing. Reloading on their behalf was rejected
because yanking the page out from under someone looking up a scoring rule is
worse than being one version behind. A first install claims an uncontrolled page
and fires the same event, so prior control is captured before registering or
every new visitor is told to reload the moment they arrive.
